This is a Prometheus exporter for [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive][csgo]. It provides statistics from diverse categories, including last matches.

## Prerequisites

One of the two, depending on your running method.

- [Go][go]
- [Docker][docker]

## Running this exporter

See [Configuration][configuration] in order to set the necessary params to run the exporter.

### Using a binary

You can download the latest version of the binary built for your architecture [here][releases].

### Using Docker

The exporter is also available as a Docker image in [DockerHub][dockerhub] and [Github CR][ghcr]. You can run it using the following example and pass the configuration as environment variables:

```shell
$ docker run \
  --name csgo_exporter \
  -p 7355:7355 \
  -e STEAM_API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
  -e STEAM_NAME=<your-user-name> \
  kinduff/csgo_exporter:latest
```

Alternative, you can use `ghcr.io/kinduff/csgo_exporter` if you want to use the Github Container Registry.

### Using the source

Optionally, you can download and build it from the sources. You have to retrieve the project sources by using one of the following way:

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/kinduff/csgo_exporter
# or
$ git clone https://github.com/kinduff/csgo_exporter.git
```

Install the needed vendors:

```shell
$ GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor
```

Then, build the binary:

```shell
$ go build -o csgo_exporter ./cmd/csgo_exporter
```

## Configuration

This exporter uses environment variables, there are no CLI support for now. The reason behind this is that it's easier to setup and treat it as a running server, instead of a CLI tool.

## Footnotes

- <b id="f1">[1]</b>: This port is being assigned for fun, since the bomb code from Counter Strike is `7355608`. [↩](#a1)
- <b id="f2">[2]</b>: Please note that the `STEAM_ID` environment variable is not required if you provide a `STEAM_NAME`, but this will add 1 HTTP call in order to fetch the SteamID. [↩](#a2)
